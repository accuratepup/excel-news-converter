The consensus estimate was for the Fed to keep interest rates at the range of 4.25%-4.5%.

      "Description": "Massachusetts subpoenaed financial technology company Robinhood last week seeking information about its new sports event futures trading product available in 49 states. It relaunched following behind-the-scenes communication with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While the federal CFTC is the de facto overseer of futures trading for now, states are now taking a close look at whether platforms such as the one from Robinhood violate state betting laws. Nevada recently sent Kalshi, the exchange that powers Robinhood‚Äôs sports event futures, a cease-and-desist letter. As Sportico has reported, industry insiders widely view state actions as a greater threat to the burgeoning futures industry than the CFTC. Reuters was the first to report the Massachusetts subpoena, with Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth Bill Galvin saying that the sports futures trading product ‚Äúis just another gimmick from a company that‚Äôs very good at gimmicks to lure investors away from sound investing.‚Äù Galvin‚Äôs office confirmed the reporting in an emailed statement but declined to provide further comment about whether it would probe platforms in addition to Robinhood. Robinhood denied wrongdoing. ‚ÄúThe event contracts offered by Robinhood Derivatives are regulated by the CFTC and offered through CFTC-registered entities,‚Äù wrote a company official in an email. ‚ÄúPrediction markets have become increasingly relevant for retail and institutional investors alike, and we‚Äôre proud to be one of the first platforms to offer these products to retail customers in a safe and regulated manner.‚Äù The subpoena reportedly asks for copies of Robinhood marketing materials and information about who in the state has engaged in March Madness futures trading through the firm. Robinhood (HOOD) stock has risen rapidly since it announced it would resume offering sports-related contracts ahead of March Madness. It closed up 9% for the day at $48.36 per share on Monday, and has increased from $36.02 on March 13. (This article has been updated with Monday‚Äôs closing stock price, and has corrected the number of states Robinhood is offering sports events futures in from 50 to 49, as an official said it has not launched in Nevada.)\n"

      "Description": "Robinhood's stock price has seen a remarkable 60% increase over the past six months, reaching $40.80 per share. This surge is partially attributed to its solid quarterly results, as detailed in a recent Yahoo Finance article published on April 10, 2025. The company's commitment to democratizing finance through its commission-free stock and crypto trading platform has been a key driver of its growth. According to data from the IndexBox platform, Robinhood's average revenue per user (ARPU) has shown exceptional growth, averaging 43.9% over the last two years. This metric is crucial as it reflects the company's ability to monetize its user base effectively, with users spending significantly more than in previous years. Furthermore, Robinhood's earnings per share (EPS) have transitioned from negative to positive over the past three years, indicating a profitable growth trajectory.

The value of the moved funds stood at $30,064,203 at the time the transfer took place. The likely reason behind the move is a whale intending to sell their funds on the aforementioned platform. The transaction coincided with a 4.6% increase in DOGE's price, pushing the asset from $0.18674 to $0.19535. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is inching closer to reaching a new adoption milestone; its holder count is currently standing at 7.97 million holders, only 30,000 short of eight million.
